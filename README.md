# ReLiEF fingerprints
Receptor Ligand surfacE Feature (ReLiEF) fingerprints for encoding molecular structure and physicochemical properties.  This video describes the use of ReLiEF fingerprints and TMAP (https://tmap.gdb.tools/) to cluster and visualize the structural similarity of Abl kinase conformations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tnHeRlLt7Y
