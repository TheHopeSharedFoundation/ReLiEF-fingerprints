Receptor Ligand surfacE Feature (ReLiEF) fingerprints for encoding molecular structure and physicochemical properties.  Essentially, ReLiEF fingerprints are generated from a molecular surface that is colored by a particular property, such as partial charge.  From the surface and color, fingerprints are generated.  These are physicochemical 3D-based fingerprints and can be used in a variety of applications such as similarity clustering, machine learning, and pharmacophore generation.  

There are two types of ReLiEF fingerprints, segmentation-based and distribution-based.  In segmentation-based ReLiEF fingerprints (sb-ReLiEF), the molecule is first oriented with respect to a common coordinate system.  The whole surface (continous surface) of the molecule is captured in a VRML file with vertex points and associated colors.  Then the surface is sliced into equally-spaced segments.  A band is moved across each segment and the points of intersection of the segment with the band are recorded as fingerprint bits.  The bits can simultaneously capture a variety of information such as distance from a plane, pharmacophore, and atom type.  The bits from each segment are then concatenated into a fingerprint.  The main advantage/disadvantage (depending on the particular application) of sb-ReLiEF is the requirement that all structures be aligned to a common coordinate system.  This video describes the use of sb-ReLiEF and TMAP (https://tmap.gdb.tools/) to cluster and visualize the structural similarity of Abl kinase conformations (from [DOI: 10.1126/science.abc2754](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc2754)): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tnHeRlLt7Y 

In contrast to sb-ReLiEF, distribution-based ReLiEF fingerprints (db-ReLiEF) do not depend on molecular orientation or position.  In db-ReLiEF, the surface of the molecule is first represented as a dot-surface (discrete surface) colored by a particular property and captured in a VRML file.  The dots representing the surface are then binned according to their color.  For each color bin, the property that the color represents and the sequence of dot addition to the bin (index/instance) are recorded with each dot, and this represents a fingerprint bit.  This binning process results in a distribution of the physicochemical 3D-based property represented by the color.  This process can be repeated for multiple properties, generating a distribution for each property.  For each property distribution and each bin, the fingerprint bits are concatenated in order of dot index into a fingerprint.  In this way, the fingerprint captures the distributions of multiple properties simultaneously, such as partial charge, distance from the center of mass, and functional group.  This video describes the use of db-ReLiEF and TMAP to cluster and visualize the partial charge similarity of PDE-10 ligands (from [DOI:10.1007/s10822-022-00478-x](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36153472/)):
